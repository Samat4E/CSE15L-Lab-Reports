 # Lab Report 1
     Installation and Setup: Visual Studio Code
     In our first lab we learned how to downloaded and install VSCode. i use to have a sublime text editor but now i am familarizing 
     my self with VScode with the help of my group and TAs.

## First, install Visual Studio Code onto your computer.

  ## **Remotely Connecting**
 Once i installed the VScode, i used the steps in this post to set the default terminal in my Visual Studio Code 
 to use the SSH(Secure Shell) to connect my computer to this server,

**Now my terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basemant and I can use both my built in terminal and VSCode interchangeably. Next we moved on and Connected to the Remote Server. For the first step, I open a terminal. Your command will look like this, but with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account. 


  ## **Running Some Commands**

Here are some of the useful commands i have tried running this commands a few times in different ways on bothcomputers. 
**-pwd,
-cd ~, 
-cd , 
-ls -lat ,
-ls -a ,**


**Onece i have done all this i come to understand the basic uses of the ssh conecting remote server and how to use it using your computer.**

## Finally
To log out of the remote server in your terminal, you can use:
**Ctrl-D ,
Run the command exit**

You can also open more terminals in VSCode (there is a little + button at the top of the terminal window where you can create another).
