     In our first lab we learned how to downloaded and install VSCode. i use to have a sublime text editor but now i am familarizing 
     my self with VScode with the help of my group and TAs.

 Once i installed the VScode, i used the steps in this post to set the default terminal in my Visual Studio Code

**Now my terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basemant and I can use both my built in terminal and VSCode interchangeably. Next we moved on and Connected to the Remote Server. For the first step, I open a terminal. Your command will look like this, but with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.
