##                                                          Lab Report 1   
##  Installation and Setup: Visual Studio Code    
      Visual Studio Code is a type of Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to help programmers keep their work organized and     
    combine various necessary code activities such as compiling, text editing, and debugging. In our first lab we learned how to      
    downloaded and install VSCode. Before i use to have a sublime text editor but now i am trying to familarize my self with 
    VScode with the help of my group and TAs.

##                                           Installing Visual Studio.

##  Remotely Connecting    
      Once you installed the VScode, you have to used the ssh username@ieng6.ucsd.edu to connect your computer to the server.   
    The SSH(Secure Shell) is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate (c.f http or hypertext     
    transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages) and share data.

**Now my terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basemant and I can use both my built in terminal and VSCode interchangeably. Next we moved on and Connected to the Remote Server. For the first step, I open a terminal. Your command will look like this, but with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account,**

Here are some of the useful commands i have tried running this commands a few times in different ways on bothcomputers.     
-pwd,    
-cd ~,     
-cd ,     
-ls -lat ,    
-ls -a ,


**Onece you  have done all this i hope you come to understand the basic uses of the ssh conecting remote server and how to use it using your computer.

## Finally
To log out of the remote server in your terminal, you can use:    
**Ctrl-D ,     
Run the command exit**
