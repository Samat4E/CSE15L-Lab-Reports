## Lab Report 4
    For the lab report we are going to reproduce the task from the week seven lab competition on our own. 
    For each step starting right after the timer 4-9 we are going to take a screenshot and explain it step   
    by step and write down exactly which keys we pressed to get to that step
## Step 1  
    The first step is to launch the terminal or VScode terminal, and then to open bash. While inside bash,  
    you type ssh cs15lwi23app@ieng6.ucsd.edu to log onto the remote computer. For me becouse i allready typed it   
    befoure i just have to press the "^" up key and Enter when i got my ssh...

## Step 2  
    The second step is simple, all you have to do is clone the provided document lab7 by copying from   
    your repository link as shown below and by pressing (control + V) or paste it into your bash program   
    after typing git clone.

**----->   *And here is the result from my bash terminal***

## Step 3  

     After cloning, you can view the documents in the Lab7 folder by typing "ls" and then pressing Enter. this will 
     exicute the files inside the lab7 folder and now we must execute the provided Java application to determine   
     whether our code contains any errors or not by copping and pesting this two provided commands.  
      javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java 
      java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamples.java  
  
 As you can see from the code below, there is one failure, so we must use nano text editor to correct the problem.  
 GNU nano is a simple terminal-based text editor. Though not as powerful as Emacs or Vim, it is easy to learn and use
